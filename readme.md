garrysmod_common
================

The include folder has all the required headers for building modules for Garry's Mod (LuaJIT and Garry's Mod headers) with C++.

The lib folder provides files for linking on each platform supported by Garry's Mod.

There's common code for premake on the premake folder for faster development. Include this folder or premake5.lua (including this folder runs the premake5.lua file by default).
